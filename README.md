## Hello, I'm Sara Johnson 👋

🚧 Bio Currently Under Construction 🚧

Growing up, I was very interested in the diversity of the world around me. I grew up in Chicago, where cultures connect and all kinds of people fill up my community.

While I've always had a love for computers, I recognized my passion for UX and Human-Centered Design in technology when I started learning more about how inaccessible technology can affect people.

My philosophy on software development is that this expanding field is a new crucial pillar in our society and technology should be accessible to every user. 

Now, as I continue my education at the University of Illinois, I am developing my skills in languages like Swift and React that will directly interact with users at the front end... And want to bring my skills in user interfaces to a company that is equally dedicated to its users.
